            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems is a way to be able to keep track of changes that happen to a certain file and be able to revert back to previous versions of a file as well. This is also a good way to see at what point in the editing process an error occurred. That way the company is able to go back to a previous version and see what changes were made to cause the error. It also makes it easier to be able to copy files to another separate directory. This all makes it very easy for multiple collaborators on one single project.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that allows users to seamlessly work on and edit projects together. It allows for users to see who made which edits and revert back to previous versions of a file. There are many platforms for Git such as GitHub and BitBucket. Both of which are able to pull from local storage and store everything onto a hosted or remote repository. Git commands are used in order to tell these platforms which actions they need to perform. Once the user has entered the proper Git commands they are able to push their local files to the main Git repository. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git Commands are used to tell git repositories what to do with files. There are many different commands that can edit files depending on where you are creating the files. Most of this is done through a terminal command line using simple Git commands. You can use commands such as "git status" "git push" "git commit" and many more to view and edit repositories that you are in locally. Once you've edited your local files, you are able to push these to your remote repository using commands such as "git add ." that will stage all of your local files to get ready to push them to your remote repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Your Local Files</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Working directories are local files stored on a computer or server that is separate from the git repository. These are often local files that are edited by a single user that are then pushed out to the combined git repository. When edits are made on the working directory they have no effect on the git repository until they are pushed out using git commands. Once the edited files are pushed and aded to the git repository then it will be the same as the local file. Other collaborators are not able to see changes made on working directories until they are pushed to the git repository. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git repositories are the collective action of either multiple users or multiple edits by a single user. They are stored remotely on a server platform such as BitBucket or GitHub. These files are them able to be pulled by all of the different collaborators to be edited and then pushed back to the main git repository. Git repositories are able to show the edits and changes made by all of the different users. They will show the latest edit made as the main page showing but on different platforms there are ways to go back to previous versions of the repository.</p>
